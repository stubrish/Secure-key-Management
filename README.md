# Secure Key Management Project

## Description
The Secure Key Management Project provides a comprehensive solution for managing cryptographic keys securely. This project employs advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of keys through various stages of their lifecycle.

### Cryptographic Techniques Used

- RSA: RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm that ensures secure key exchange and encryption. In this project, RSA is used to generate key pairs for encrypting and decrypting sensitive information.
-  PKCS1_OAEP: PKCS1_OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding) is a padding scheme for RSA encryption that provides enhanced security. It is used to pad the plaintext before encryption, ensuring that the encryption process is secure against certain types of attacks.
- PBKDF2: PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) is a key derivation function used to derive a cryptographic key from a password. PBKDF2 applies a pseudorandom function (such as HMAC) to the password along with a salt value and iterates the process multiple times to produce a secure key, which is then used in the encryption and decryption processes.

This project integrates these techniques to offer a robust and secure mechanism for key management, ensuring that cryptographic keys are generated, stored, and retrieved securely.
## Purpose
